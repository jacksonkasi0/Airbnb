<h3>I would like to report one thing first.</h3>

Forgive me first.
In response to the "Hotel Management" project you gave me, I changed it to airbnb.
I have done the redux features that you have given in it, except that the application is different.
I have done this in order to add good value to my portfolio.
I did not mention you in this.
And if you give me a review, I will delete this comment immediately.


Thanks :)
